ave you noticed anything new about news broadcasts? Not long ago, all-news cable stations began to position a scroll-
ing bar at th<br>e bottom of our TV screens. The goal: to provide concise “headlines” that go beyond what the on-screen news anchors and correspondents are covering. Programmers now even sometimes add a second headline bar to add a layer of text to the scrolling one. 
Why do th<br>ey do this? Because the news now changes so rapidly and the volume of fresh information has become so great that it simply can’t be presented any longer within the time constraints of a typical news broadcast. Moreover, many viewers don’t have the time to wait for the news. They want it all at once, now. Programmers also realize that people have become increasingly able to absorb several streams of information at once. So why not present it that way?
Our l<br>ives had begun to reflect a similar change long before this latest approach to communicating news took hold.

Making It Up in Volume<br>
The Institute for the Future, Pitney Bowes Inc.,<br> and San
Jose State University did a study in late 19<br>96 that elicited
responses from 972 employees of Fortune <br>1,000 companies. It revealed that workers send and receive an average of 178 messages each day via telephone (24 per day, on average), e-mail (14 per day), voicemail (11 per day), and other mediums. 84% indicated that at least three times per hour their work was interrupted by messages.
And this was in 1996.The numbers tod<br>ay would be much higher.
ing amounts of complex data that<br> we need to do our jobs, manage our personal finances, communicate with friends, and organize the ever-expanding volume of information we receive.
As a result, we can be far m<br>ore productive than perhaps any other generation in history. And we now have the tools—technological, str0ategic, and personal—that can help us in our efforts to manage our time, enhance our efficiency, and better organize our lives. All it takes is to be open to change and willing to embrace all those new things and ideas that are available to us.
We can indeed tame time.<br>
To do so, you must be alert to the challenges that all these changes have generated. For example, when you open your email <br>in the morning, you probably face a blizzard of communications. Some of these are about things you need to know. Many, however, are mere clutter—ads providing information others want you to know, but about which you couldn’t care less, junk mail that clogs your in-box and demands your time to sort through.
And it’s about more than e-mail. Maybe you remember when secretaries handled correspondence, answered phones, screened <br>calls, provided reminders of deadlines and appointments, and helped to prioritize the day’s tasks? Today, in many companies, managers sit before their computers, typing their own correspondence, answering their own phones and voicemail messages, making entries in their calendars, and setting priorities without the aid of an assistant. With all of the timesaving attributes of these new technologies, who, after all, needs a
 
secretary? It’s just the way things are today. <br>
